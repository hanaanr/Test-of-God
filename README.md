### Description
'Test of God' is an interactive comic featuring original content, created using HTML, CSS, and the GSAP library on JavaScript. 

The comic tells the story of a student as he struggles to answer the questions on his math quiz. In a moment of desperation, he prays to god asking for help. The user is then presented with the question and a textbox to enter the answer. Depending on the user's input, the student scores either an A+ or an F on the quiz. 

The overall theme is based on pencil drawings/text, keeping in line with the school/classroom setting. 

### Process
We first decided on the overall story and plot line, and then decided on the sound and animated features. We split up the work such that one of us started working on the illustrations (mostly using ProCreate and few using Illustrator), and the other two began setting up the website. Once the basic website was up, the illustrations were modified as needed. We proceeded to work on different parts of the website, which was coordinated and coherently combined+organised in one file by Safal. 

### Reflection
We met most of our expectations with regard to theme and sticking to the original concept. Some of the changes we introduced along the way are:
* Initially, we intended to the display our panels in boxes. We later dropped this idea and adopted a more fluid, spacious look. 
* We reduced the number of questions posed to the user from 3-4 to 1 owing to time constraints.
* Depending on whether the user answers the question correctly, the end result displayed on the returned exam sheet is either an A+ or an F grade, giving rise to different reactions from the student. We were originally only going to display a single result. 
* Most importantly, we initially intended to use simple CSS and parallax effects (using the Rellax library in JS) to display our animations. However, we later decided to use the GSAP library in order to create more complicated effects, especially using the gsap plugin scrollTrigger.
